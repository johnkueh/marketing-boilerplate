Hi,

My name is Zhong Ming, and I do respond to Zenny too.

I am very passionate about delivering great customer experience through the use of technologies:

* **Digital (Web) analytics**: Deliver truly actionable insights beyond 99% of the reports you have seen
* **Marketing automation**: Engage customers in a timely and highly personalized manner
* **A/B testing**: Challenge assumptions, deliver experiences that customers want, not what we think they want

I am well-versed in Adobe Experience Cloud, both technical and business-wise.

Not exactly a fan of Google stack in this area, but that doesn’t mean I can’t handle it.

Good to see you and let’s connect on LinkedIn.
